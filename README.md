# chess-ruby

Simple chess program

Input move to the command line using the standard algebraic chess notation (eg: e5, e4, Qxe6 Bc4, Ra3, Nc3, 0-0, 0-0-0, ...)

To save the game at any point of the game, you can input "save" instead of the notation. You will be prompted to input the name of the game you want to save.

At the beginning of the game, you will be prompted to inpput a saved game you want to continue. If an invalid name is given, a new game will be started.

To be added: dissambiguation, en passant, and invalid input checker.
